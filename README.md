# Converter

This project was made in line with a Makers Academy TDD Workshop.

The aim of the workshop is to develop and practice TDD skills, taking a User Story and turning this into a Domain Model to test drive. 

The expectation is to convert numbers 1 to 10 to Roman Numerals.

To use this, clone the repository and run in terminal using irb.
